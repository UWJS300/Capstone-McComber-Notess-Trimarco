# The Mindful Reader

## What does it do?

This app allows you to track your mood while you read the news or browse other websites. Tracking your mood as you engage in your everyday online activities can give you an opportunity to better understand how the technology you use affects you.

## How does it work?

This app works in the Google Chrome browser as a Chrome extension. Once the extension is installed, you can set alerts to log your mood at intervals. Then, you can view your mood history in the web app.
